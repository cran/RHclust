Description: Non-parametric clustering of joint pattern multi-genetic/epigenetic factors. The goal of this package is to cluster subjects based on gene features including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), DNA methylation (CPG), and gene expression (GE). The novel concept follows the general K-means (Hartigan and Wong (1979) <doi:10.2307/2346830> framework but uses weighted Euclidean distances across the gene features to cluster subjects. This approach is unique in that it attempts to capture all pairwise interactions in an effort to cluster based on their complex biological interactions.
